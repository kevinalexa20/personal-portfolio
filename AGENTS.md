# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This Astro 5 personal portfolio keeps all source code in `src/`. Pages live under `src/pages` (e.g., `index.astro`, route folders like `[...blog]/`), shared UI in `src/components/`, and content-driven collections in `src/content/`. Reusable data such as testimonials or navigation items sit in `src/data/`, while helper utilities are grouped under `src/utils/`. Static assets (images, fonts, icons) belong in `public/`, and any CDN-ready bundles generated by Astro stay inside `.astro/`—never edit that cache manually. Top-level configs (`astro.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`) control build, styling, and type support.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run `npm install` once to sync dependencies. Use `npm run dev` to start the local server at `http://localhost:4321` with hot reload. Ship-ready builds come from `npm run build`, and you can inspect them via `npm run preview`. Quality gates are bundled in `npm run check`, which sequentially executes `astro check`, `eslint .`, and `prettier --check .`. When a lint fix is obvious, prefer `npm run fix` or the narrower `npm run fix:eslint` / `npm run fix:prettier`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
The `.editorconfig` enforces UTF-8 files, LF line endings, two-space indentation, and trailing newline. Astro and TypeScript components should use PascalCase filenames (e.g., `HeroBanner.astro`), while page routes favour kebab-case (`services.astro`) or bracket syntax for dynamic segments. Tailwind classes follow utility-first patterns; consolidate shared variants in `src/components/ui/` when possible. Always run Prettier and ESLint before committing to keep imports ordered and attributes wrapped consistently.

## Testing Guidelines
There is no dedicated unit-test suite yet, so rely on `npm run check` plus manual verification in `npm run dev`. Treat new features as opportunities to add integration coverage: co-locate Playwright or Vitest specs under `src/tests/` when introduced, mirroring the route or component name. Document any new test commands in `package.json` and update GitHub Actions if they are required for CI.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Recent history mixes imperative summaries (`update june2025`) with conventional commits (`feat: contact page`). Prefer the conventional format—`type: short summary`—so automation can parse intent. Write commits that bundle related changes only; use present-tense verbs and keep messages under 72 characters. Pull requests should include: purpose, key screenshots or URLs for visual changes, a checklist of commands executed (e.g., `npm run build`), and links to issues or discussions when applicable. Confirm that CI (`GitHub Actions` workflow) passes across Node 18/20/22 before requesting review.
